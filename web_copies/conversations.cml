<p>This legendary Spanish cultural institution <strong>treasures thousands of letters written by the leading figures of Spanish culture</strong> during the &apos;La Edad de Plata&apos;, a period of rich intellectual expansion during the first decades of the 20th century in Spain.<br /></p>
<p>The institution, that has already digitized and marked up the letters, request us to create a <strong>visual tool</strong> to explore a set of them. I designed and developed a data visualization that includes <strong>two force layout versions</strong>, a classic one for the general view and a beeswarm to show every person&apos;s correspondence. The visualization also features <strong>timelines that act as filters</strong>, and a final view where you can <strong>read the entire conversation and be delighted</strong> by the way they used to write.</p></body>
