<p>I am a Data Visualization designer and developer, with a strong background in research.</p>
<p>After graduating as a <strong>Sociologist</strong> and <strong>Advertising &amp; PR</strong>, I started my professional career as a <strong>researcher</strong>. I worked simultaneously doing user research for <strong>digital products</strong> and carrying out <strong>social studies</strong>. I loved and I still love being a researcher, but what <strong>attracted</strong> me the most was <strong>finding</strong> and <strong>communicating</strong> revealing <strong>insights</strong> in a clear and engaging way.</p>
<p>In 2012 I started teaching myself about the theory and practice of <strong>Data Visualization</strong>. At this point the <strong>code</strong> came into my life. I realized then that developing the visualizations was as fun as finding and communicating the research insights. I specially enjoyed working with <strong>D3.js</strong>, in which I specialized.</p>
<p>One year later I started my career as a Data Visualizer. That&apos;s <strong>10 years of experience</strong> already.</p>
<p>Currently, I work creating unique, <strong>made-to-order data visualizations</strong>, expressly designed for a specific dataset, so I mainly work with static data, no matter how big or small. I also create reusable data visualizations, for those datasets with identical structure but different content.</p>
<p>I <strong>love mails</strong>, hearing about <strong>new projects</strong> and <strong>challenges</strong> so feel free to contact me with any questions, any data project or even just to say hello.</p></body>
